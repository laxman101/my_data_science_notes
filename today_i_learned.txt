Today I learned on inner join, left join and right join in SQL. 
Inner join is the basic join that gives the results of both the left and right tables values for their respective keys. 
Left join gives all the records from the left table regardless of having corresponding records in the right table. 
Right join works exactly in the other way where right table provides all the records whether or not it has a corresponding records in the left table.
